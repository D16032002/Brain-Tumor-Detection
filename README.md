# Brain-Tumor-Detection

Problem Statement: To predicta and localize brain tumors through image segmentation from brain MRI dataset available in Kaggle

Part 1: Classification model that will detect tumors from MRI image
Prerequisites: Deep Learning

Libraries:
pandas
numpy
seaborn
matplotlib
cv2
skimage
tensorflow
sklearn

First we import the required libraries. This process is followed by the conversion of dataset in csv format to a dataframe using pandas library. Mask is the image of the part of the brain, affected by a tumor, of the corresponding MRI image.
